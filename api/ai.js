/* Coach command bar — intent parser.
 *
 * The page is static and ships under a CSP that blocks external requests, so it
 * cannot call Anthropic directly, and an API key in client-side JS is a public
 * key. This function is the only place the key exists: the browser POSTs a
 * sentence to /api/ai (same origin) and gets back a structured action.
 *
 * The model NEVER executes anything. It returns {action, target, body} and the
 * client decides whether that is allowed, showing a confirmation for anything
 * that reaches a family. Parsing and doing are deliberately separate.
 *
 * ── Threat model ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Once ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set this endpoint spends real money on every call,
 * so an open route here is a billing hole, not just an abuse one. Defences, in
 * the order a request meets them:
 *
 *   1. Method lock       — anything but POST is rejected before any work.
 *   2. Content-Type lock — blocks the simple-request forms (text/plain,
 *                          form-encoded) that a cross-origin page can send
 *                          WITHOUT a CORS preflight. This is the actual CSRF
 *                          boundary; the Origin check below is defence in depth.
 *   3. Origin lock       — same-origin only. No CORS headers are ever emitted,
 *                          so a browser will not surface the response to a
 *                          foreign page even if one reaches us.
 *   4. Size lock         — body and field caps before the model is called.
 *   5. Rate limit        — per-IP sliding window (see the caveat below).
 *
 * What this does NOT defend against: a determined attacker with curl and a
 * rotating IP pool. Origin and Content-Type are browser-enforced, not
 * server-verifiable. Closing that needs a signed token minted per session,
 * which needs real auth — tracked, not solved here.
