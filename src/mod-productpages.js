Payout state moves from pending to in transit to paid, so a balance never disappears behind a generic success message.

This mirrors the single-coach rule the live marketplace already enforces. Enterprise extends that same gate across an organization's whole staff rather than trusting the business to police itself."],

A badge that stops being true stops showing. Parents should report any mismatch between the person listed and the person who arrives, because clearance never travels to a substitute."],
