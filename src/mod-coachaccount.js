/* mod-coachaccount.js — a real coach account.
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   WHAT WAS THERE BEFORE

   "Become a coach" called enterCoachPortal(), which set S.portal="coach" and
   routed to the dashboard BEFORE asking who you were. So a stranger who had
   never signed in saw Apex Performance Club's dashboard — a seeded business
   that does not exist — with its listings, its schedule and its earnings,
   behind a login sheet. Signing in did not help: the form called

       completeAuth({...SEED.user, role:"provider"})

   which fabricates a verified session out of the seed regardless of what you
   typed. No password was checked, no account was created, nothing was written.
   Whatever a coach filled in vanished on reload, because there was nowhere for
   it to go.

   WHAT THIS DOES

   Signup and sign-in go to GoTrue for real, with role=provider in the user
   metadata that handle_new_user() reads to build the profiles row. Then the
   coach gets a `providers` record they own, and every field they fill in is
   PATCHed onto it.

   THE BACKEND OWNS THE TRUST BOUNDARY. RLS scopes a coach's writes to their own
   provider row, and server triggers freeze the trust and payout columns. The
   public catalogue may expose an approved listing without a badge; accepting a
   booking still requires the server-side provider safety gate.

     providers_insert_owner   INSERT  authenticated  check (owner_id = auth.uid())
     providers_select_owner   SELECT  authenticated  using (owner_id = auth.uid())
     providers_update_owner   UPDATE  authenticated  using (owner_id = auth.uid())

   So a coach can create and edit exactly their own row and nobody else's, while
   column-freeze triggers prevent a hostile client from granting trust or payout
   state to itself.

   A NEW COACH IS NOT BOOKABLE, AND THAT IS THE POINT. The column defaults are
   status='pending', background_check_status='none', verification_status=
   'unverified'. Even if an unbadged listing is discoverable, the booking trigger
   refuses it until approval and the required personal check are current. Signing
   up never grants the right to take a family booking.

   IMAGES. `providers.avatar_url` / `logo_url` and the `provider-media` bucket
   were added 2026-08-12 — the project previously had NO storage buckets at
   all, so an uploaded photo had nowhere to go. Writes are owner-scoped by path:
   the first folder segment must equal auth.uid(), so a coach cannot overwrite
   another coach's headshot by guessing a filename.

       ---------------------------------------------------------------------
       IT USUALLY EXISTS ALREADY. handle_new_user() fires on auth.users insert
       and, when the metadata says role=provider, inserts a providers row
       itself — named from raw_user_meta_data->>'name', or 'My Academy' when
       that is empty. It reads 'name', NOT the 'business_name' this client
       sends, so a coach who typed "QA Probe Athletics" got a business called
       "My Academy" and no error anywhere: the row was created, just not by us
       and not with their name.

       So the job here is mostly to RENAME. If the coach typed a name during
       signup it is their stated intent and it wins — applied once, then
       forgotten, so a later rename in settings is not overwritten on next
       login.

       The insert path is kept for the case the trigger did not run (an account
       that became a provider later). `on conflict (owner_id)` in the trigger
       tells us owner_id is UNIQUE, so a race here loses cleanly rather than

       -----------------------------------------------------------------------
       Until now the "Create a listing" form only pushed a row into the
       in-memory PROGRAMS array (with a fabricated verified:true), so the
       listing lived in one browser tab, vanished on reload, and no family
       could ever see it. This writes the real `programs` row under the coach's
       own JWT — RLS `programs_insert_owner` already permits it (WITH CHECK the
       provider is owned by auth.uid()). status='published' so it goes live
       immediately; booking is still gated server-side by the
       enforce_booking_provider_verified trigger, so an unverified coach's
       listing is visible-but-not-bookable, never a safety hole.
       cancellation_policy is left to its 'flexible' default and NOT exposed.
       RECONCILED 2026-08-17 with the subscription model: Sporv takes 0% of a
