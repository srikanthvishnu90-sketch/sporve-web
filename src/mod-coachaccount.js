/* mod-coachaccount.js — a real coach account.
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   WHAT WAS THERE BEFORE

   "Become a coach" called enterCoachPortal(), which set S.portal="coach" and
   routed to the dashboard BEFORE asking who you were. So a stranger who had
   never signed in saw Apex Performance Club's dashboard — a seeded business
   that does not exist — with its listings, its schedule and its earnings,
   behind a login sheet. Signing in did not help: the form called

       completeAuth({...SEED.user, role:"provider"})

   which fabricates a verified session out of the seed regardless of what you
   typed. No password was checked, no account was created, nothing was written.
   Whatever a coach filled in vanished on reload, because there was nowhere for
   it to go.

   WHAT THIS DOES

   Signup and sign-in go to GoTrue for real, with role=provider in the user
   metadata that handle_new_user() reads to build the profiles row. Then the
   coach gets a `providers` record they own, and every field they fill in is
   PATCHed onto it.

   THE BACKEND WAS ALREADY READY, which is worth stating because it is why this
   file is short. RLS on `providers`, verified 2026-08-12:

     providers_insert_owner   INSERT  authenticated  check (owner_id = auth.uid())
     providers_select_owner   SELECT  authenticated  using (owner_id = auth.uid())
     providers_update_owner   UPDATE  authenticated  using (owner_id = auth.uid())
     providers_select_public  SELECT  anon+auth      using (status='approved'
                                                       and provider_safety_cleared(id))

   So a coach can create and edit exactly their own row and nobody else's, and
   the server enforces it — this client could be hostile and the rule holds.

   A NEW COACH IS NOT PUBLIC, AND THAT IS THE POINT. The column defaults are
   status='pending', background_check_status='none', verification_status=
   'unverified'. providers_select_public requires 'approved' AND a cleared
   safety check, so a freshly created coach is invisible to browse and search
   until a human approves them and the check clears. Signing up does not put an
   unchecked adult in front of a family, which is the whole product promise.

   IMAGES. `providers.avatar_url` / `logo_url` and the `provider-media` bucket
   were added 2026-08-12 — the project previously had NO storage buckets at
   all, so an uploaded photo had nowhere to go. Writes are owner-scoped by path:
   the first folder segment must equal auth.uid(), so a coach cannot overwrite
   another coach's headshot by guessing a filename.

    /* Get the coach's provider row, creating it only if it is genuinely absent.
       ---------------------------------------------------------------------
       IT USUALLY EXISTS ALREADY. handle_new_user() fires on auth.users insert
       and, when the metadata says role=provider, inserts a providers row
       itself — named from raw_user_meta_data->>'name', or 'My Academy' when
       that is empty. It reads 'name', NOT the 'business_name' this client
       sends, so a coach who typed "QA Probe Athletics" got a business called
       "My Academy" and no error anywhere: the row was created, just not by us
       and not with their name.

       So the job here is mostly to RENAME. If the coach typed a name during
       signup it is their stated intent and it wins — applied once, then
       forgotten, so a later rename in settings is not overwritten on next
       login.

       The insert path is kept for the case the trigger did not run (an account
       that became a provider later). `on conflict (owner_id)` in the trigger
       tells us owner_id is UNIQUE, so a race here loses cleanly rather than
       producing two businesses for one coach. */

       function; the coach had no way to connect a bank at all.

       Stripe account, writes stripe_account_id with the service role, and
       returns chargesEnabled read from STRIPE, not from our column. This client
       sends a return URL and follows a link.
