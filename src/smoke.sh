# Structural assertions cannot see whether text is readable. This repo has

# computed-style defects that only a browser measuring real pixels catches.
#
# The coach portal is held at zero because it was built clean and there is no
# reason to let it rot. The family portal carried 16 pre-existing failures; the
# 2026-08-13 slate adoption took that to 6; the 2026-08-14 C2/C3 rebuild took it
# to 2 — the deleted template sections carried four of the failures. Lower it again
# whenever a change improves it — a baseline that never drops is a todo, not a test.
# it is ratcheted instead of gated: the number may fall, never rise. Blocking
# on it today would stop every unrelated change until someone fixes 16 old
# defects, which is how a check gets deleted rather than satisfied.
# Baseline 2 = the two ACCEPTED pre-existing pairs on trust (.pill.warn
# "Verification pending" #B87800 on its warm tint, 3.30:1 — the warn palette
# is established across the app; re-inking it is its own change, not a ride-
# along). Anything above 2 is a regression.
# 4, not 2: the nav "Join waitlist" pill uses the EXACT reference slate
# --slate #7692AE with white text (owner 2026-08-24, "use the exact color").
# White-on-#7692AE is 3.23:1 — it clears WCAG 3:1 for UI components but not the

# ── No orange on a COLD first paint (no render() call) ────────────────────
# The token-table check below tests the FUNCTION. This tests the DOM the first
# visitor actually receives. Both are needed: the ordering bug that shipped
# orange to production had a correct sportColor() and a correct token map, and
# still painted orange, because NO_ORANGE_ACTIVE was assigned AFTER the body
# string was built. Every console check was a second render and came back clean.
# This one must not call render() — touching it warms the page and hides the bug.
# The re-navigation is LOAD-BEARING: without it this assertion runs on a page
# that dozens of earlier assertions have already rendered, and it passed against
# the known-bad ordering. An assertion that cannot fail is worse than no
# assertion, because it manufactures confidence. Verified to go red when the
# assignment is moved back below the body build.
# Clear persisted state BEFORE the reload. S round-trips through sessionStorage,
# so whichever route the previous assertion left behind is the route this page
# restores — and the orange ban is scoped to `home`. Without this the check
# inherited route=explore and reported 6 "orange" elements that were correctly
# orange. Cold means cold: no stored route, no warm render, nothing carried in.
