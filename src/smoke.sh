# assertion, because it manufactures confidence. Verified to go red when the
# assignment is moved back below the body build.
# Clear persisted state BEFORE the reload. S round-trips through sessionStorage,
# so whichever route the previous assertion left behind is the route this page
# restores — and the orange ban is scoped to `home`. Without this the check
