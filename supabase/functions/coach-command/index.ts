// coach-command  (Supabase Edge Function) — the agentic Coach AI Chatbox turn
// ============================================================================
// docs/COACH-AI-CHATBOX.md. ONE call per coach turn. Structured output
//   { intent, tool_calls[], reply_text, needs_confirmation, confidence }.
//
// THE LAW — INTERPRET-ONLY (encoded here, not just documented):
//   • This function NEVER mutates data and NEVER sends a message. It proposes.
//   • READS it may execute and return (from the RLS-scoped context it already
//     assembled). WRITES/DRAFTS it returns as PROPOSALS the client confirms and
//     dispatches through the EXISTING repo methods (createService,
//     addAvailabilityException, cancelBooking, the ai_draft draft/approve/send
//     pipeline, camp-broadcast, …). NO new mutation path is created here (L-012).
//   • Every write/draft tool_call comes back with needs_confirmation = true.
//
// Runs FULLY as the coach: an anon client carrying the coach's JWT. Every context
// read is therefore RLS-scoped to the caller (no service role, no privilege
// escalation). The ai-gateway call is made with the coach's JWT too, so the
// gateway's per-user durable rate limit (consume_edge_rate_limit) governs abuse.
//
// Mirrors setup-interview (JWT auth, ai-gateway call, CORS, env, harden step) and
// camp-broadcast (getUser + RLS-scoped context assembly).
//
// Input:  { text: string, image_present?: boolean, history?: [{role, content}] }
//   image_present is a BOOLEAN — the image BYTES are NEVER sent to the interpreter
//   (privacy + cost). On approval the client uploads via the existing repo path;
//   the model only needs to know an image is attached to propose an image tool.
// Output: { intent, tool_calls, reply_text, needs_confirmation, confidence,
//           model?, audit_id? } | { error }
